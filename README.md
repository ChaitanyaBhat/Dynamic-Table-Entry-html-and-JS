# Dynamic-Table Entry

It is a demonstration of a table which grows as you enter the data. It is developed using HTML and JavaScript.

User interface is as shown in the below image.

There are three columns. Only one row exists in the beginning which has 3 cells where each cell is a text boxe. Tab key moves the cursor to the next cell. Clicking tab key from third cell of each row adds new row to the bottom of the table and the cursor moves to the first cell of the new row.

Any data can be entered in the cells. Pressing the enter key in any cell moves the cursor to a new line of the same cell by expanding the row height.
